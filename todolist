# need to remove old particles.
 -> Solution
    : particle should be implemented as dequeue(), which have small capacity
    : and then, when real state transition is worked, oldest particles is get out.  (e.g., 5%. 10%)


(#) remove rollout
(#) If there is no any connection with macro cell, give a large penelty.
    - as well as all of GMU are not dicorved
(#) remove semi-lazy parameters in state
    -> trjectory prediction is only used for a simulation.
(#) grap similar belief node
(#) in particle sampling, give probability according to previous state.



# need to implement line 11 and 16 in POMCPOW

# POMDP
 - observation
    : GMU is observed when the UAV is in that cell, otherwise it is not observerd.

# SL implementation
 - error distance according to predicted path length
    - Skip as much as predicted path length previously

# next work
 - if new state is already existed in the tree, the each node has own hash value so that new state link to existing state node
