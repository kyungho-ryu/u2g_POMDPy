# need to remove old particles.
 -> Solution
    : particle should be implemented as dequeue(), which have small capacity
    : and then, when real state transition is worked, oldest particles is get out.  (e.g., 5%. 10%)

# POMDP
 - observation
    : GMU is observed when the UAV is in that cell, otherwise it is not observerd.

# SL implementation
 - error distance according to predicted path length
    - Skip as much as predicted path length previously

# next work
 - if new state is already existed in the tree, the each node has own hash value so that new state link to existing state node
